\section{Automated Variance Reduction Methods for Global Solutions}
\label{sec:GlobalVR}

Variance reduction methods for global solutions are designed to obtain an even
distribution of error across several tallies or a tally map that spans the
entire problem phase-space.
The previous section detailed several methods that automate variance reduction
for localized tallies. However, for global solutions these methods do not work
well. The global tally suffers from a large range in variance across the
physical problem space, and the solution is dependent on the flux distribution
throughout the problem. Here several methods are described that provide
automated variance reduction for global solutions or multiple tallies. The
general principle that these methods follow is that by distributing particles
evenly throughout the Monte Carlo problem, a global tally will have
approximately the same sample size in each region, resulting in a uniform
variance across the tally. This often requires a forward deterministic solution
to determine the density of forward particles throughout the problem, and then
using that forward distribution to aid in generating an importance map. The
methods described here use this solution to generate a variety of variance
reduction parameters for Monte Carlo, with varying results.

\subsection{Cooper's Isotropic Weight Windows}
\label{subsec:CooperGlobal}

Cooper and Larsen developed a weight window technique to reduce the variance of
Monte Carlo global solutions \cite{cooper_automated_2001} using a calculation of
the forward flux from solutions obtained from diffusion, quasidiffusion
\cite{miften_quasi-diffusion_1993}, or pure
Monte Carlo. In their work, Cooper
and Larsen utilized a forward solution to the transport equation to generate
weight window values to uniformly distribute particles throughout the problem.
By doing so, the variance in the
scalar flux remained relatively constant throughout the problem for a
problem-wide tally, rather than
rising significantly with increasing distance from the forward source. Cooper's
``isotropic'' weight windows (named because they were not dependent on $\hat\Omega$ )
dependent on $\vec{r}$ are given by:
\begin{subequations}
\label{coopers}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{ww}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\phi(\vec{r})}{max \phi(\vec{r})}
  \label{eq:coopertarget}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  ww(\vec{r})_{top} = \rho \bar{ww}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  ww(\vec{r})_{bottom} = \frac{\bar{ww}(\vec{r})}{\rho}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the weight window scaling factor.
\end{subequations}
Note that by setting the weight window target value to be inversely
proportional to the total flux in the cell, the density of particles throughout
the problem ends up being roughly constant. Also note from Eq.
\eqref{eq:coopertarget} that the weight windows are dependent on space only.

In practice, Cooper's algorithm was to iteratively switch between solving the
diffusion equation with transport correctors (Eddington factors described by
\cite{goldin_quasi-diffusion_1964}); a process
known as quasidiffusion \cite{goldin_quasi-diffusion_1964,
miften_quasi-diffusion_1993}, and with a Monte Carlo solution. An initial
quasidiffusion solution was used to generate weight windows, and then after a
time the Monte Carlo solution was used to generate updated eddington factors for
the quasidiffusion solution.

Because Cooper's method depended on Monte Carlo to generate the Eddington
factors for the quasidiffusion problem, this method was limited by the iterative
switch between the quasidiffusion solution and the Monte Carlo solution. The
frequency by which this switching happens is entirely up to the user, but may
drastically affect the efficiency of the method. Further, Cooper notes that we
do not know at what point in time (for which number of particles N) the Monte
Carlo solution becomes more accurate than the quasidiffusion solution, which is
an important issue in choosing solution parameters.

\subsection{Becker's Global Weight Windows}
\label{subsec:BeckerGlobal}

Becker, in addition to developing a local VR method as discussed in Section
\ref{sec:beckerlocal}, developed a global space-
energy- weight correction method both with (Section \ref{sec:AngleVR}) and
without directional biasing \cite{becker_hybrid_2007, becker_hybrid_2009}.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq.beckerglobal}
Becker's global method utilizes a formulation of the energy- and space-
dependent contributon flux like eqs. \eqref{eq:beckerconributon} and
\eqref{eq:beckerconributonspace}, but defines the spatial parameter as:
$B(\vec{r})$:
\begin{equation}
  B(\vec{r}) = \tilde{\phi^c}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
Similarly to FW-CADIS, Becker's method defines a different adjoint source
distribution depending on the response desired for the calculation:
\begin{equation}
  q^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{1}{\phi(\vec{r},E)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  q^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{\sigma_d(\vec{r},E)}
                                {\int_0^{\infty} \sigma_d(\vec{r},E) dE}
\end{equation}
The space- and energy- dependent weight windows are:
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{B(\vec{r})}{\phi^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E)}
\label{eq:beckerglobalww}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Becker's method is similar to both Cooper's earlier method and FW-CADIS in that
it distributes response evenly throughout the problem. However, like FW-CADIS
(Section \ref{subsec:FWCADIS}),
the global response weight window is proportional to the forward response,
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w}(\vec{r},E) \propto \frac{\int \sigma(\vec{r},E) \phi (\vec{r},E) dE}
                                  {\sigma (\vec{r},E)}
\end{equation}
rather than the forward flux as it is with Cooper's method, where
$\bar{w}(\vec{r},E) \propto \phi(\vec{r},E)$ .

 In implementation, both Becker's global method and Cooper's global method
 undersampled the source (in comparison to FW-CADIS, which will be described in
 Section \ref{subsec:FWCADIS}) for a specified calculation
 time. However, Becker's method sampled ~1/3 the number of particles that
 Cooper's method did. Notably, Becker's method did obtain better relative
 uncertainties for low values in the problem.

\subsection{FW-CADIS}
\label{subsec:FWCADIS}

In 2007, Peplow, Blakeman, and Wagner \cite{peplow_advanced_2007} proposed three
methods by which variance reduction could be decreased in global mesh tallies in
deep-penetration radiation transport problems. The first method, using a CADIS
calculation where the adjoint source is defined at the problem boundary, aimed
at moving particles outward to the problem edges.
The second method used standard CADIS but instead
defined each cell as equally important, so the adjoint source was defined
equally throughout the problem phase-space. The last method, called Forward-Weighted
CADIS (FW-CADIS), distributed the adjoint source across mesh cells as an inverse
relation to the forward response of the cell. In their work, Peplow et al. found
that the first method had large uncertainties in areas of the problem distant
from the boundary; the second method, performed slightly better than analog, but
not significantly, and the third method had the most uniform uncertainty
distribution.

FW-CADIS
\cite{wagner_forward-weighted_2007,wagner_forward-weighted_2009,wagner_forward-weighted_2010}
built off of existing theory, namely Cooper's
concept of using a forward deterministic calculation to evenly distribute
particles throughout the problem subspace, to obtain global tallies. However,
Wagner et al. took a different approach than Cooper: by using a forward
deterministic estimate of the flux or desired response as the adjoint source for
an adjoint calculation, biasing parameters for global responses could be
calculated in the same way as CADIS. Additionally, these biasing parameters
would be consistenly biased in the same manner as CADIS.

The adjoint source for the adjoint calculation is dependent on the
desired response for the system. The generic description for the adjoint source
is given by Eq. \eqref{eq:adjointsourcesimple} and more specific parameters are
given by Eqs. \eqref{eq:FWCadglobaldose}-\eqref{eq:FWCadglobalflux2}. First, we
can describe a general form of the adjoint source definition for all
phase-space, $P$, as:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger}} (P)=\frac{\sigma_d(P)}{R}.
\end{equation}
\label{eq:adjointsourcesimple}
Thus the adjoint source definition is dependent on the detector (or tally)
cross-section and whatever response is being calculated in the system. Depending
on whether the response is a flux or a dose rate, the adjoint source will
differ. For example,
the adjoint source for the spatially dependent global dose, $\int
\phi(\vec{r},E)\sigma_d(\vec{r},E) dE$ is:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r } ,E)= \frac { \sigma _{ d }(\vec { r } ,E) }
       { \int { \sigma _{ d }(\vec { r } ,E)\psi (\vec { r } ,E,) } dE }.
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobaldose}
The adjoint source for the spatially dependent total flux $\int \phi(\vec{r},E)
dE $ is:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r }) = \frac { 1 }{ \int { \phi (\vec { r } ,E) } dE }.
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobalflux}
Last,
the adjoint source for the energy- and spatially- dependent flux
$\phi(\vec{r},E)$ can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r } ,E) = \frac { 1 }{\phi (\vec { r } ,E) }.
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobalflux2}
\end{subequations}

The process followed by FW-CADIS is to initially run a deterministic forward
calculation to obtain the foward response. The solution from the deterministic
forward problem is then used to set the source distribution for the adjoint
solution. A second deterministic calculation is run to obtain the adjoint
solution. The adjoint solution is then used to generate variance reduction
parameters in the same manner as CADIS.

Initial implementations of CADIS

\subsection{Other Notable Methods}
Baker and Larsen showed that the exponential transform can be used to generate
VR parameters for global low-variance solutions in Monte Carlo
\cite{baker_localexponential_1993}. In this work, Baker used a forward diffusion
solution to generate parameters for a combination of VR techniques: implicit
capture and weight cutoff, geometry splitting / Russian roulette and implicit
capture and a weight cutoff, and the exponential transform combined with
implicit capture and a weight cutoff. The exponential transform method was then
compared to the other combinations of VR techniques to quantify its success.
In their work, Baker and Larsen found that
this approach did not work well for highly scattering problems, where geometry
splitting and Russian roulette were generally better options. Their work did not
focus on generating weight window values, nor was it tested on deep-penetration
shielding problems.

Van Wijk's method, like many of the hybrid methods discussed in this section,
is a variance reduction method
designed to operate with little user input \cite{van_wijk_easy_2011}. Van Wijk
et al. described an automated weight window generator that used iterative Monte
Carlo calculations of the forward flux to generate weight window values. The
weight window target values could be determined based on either a flux-centered
scheme like Cooper's (eq. \eqref{eq:coopertarget})
or by using a ratio of the square roots of the fluxes. The
second method is a combination of Cooper's weight window target value and
knowing that the relative error in a region
is proportional to the square root of the number
of particles.
Van Wijk et al. applied their method to a PWR facility and observed a FOM
increase by a factor of $>$200 when compared to analog Monte Carlo. However, as
with other Monte Carlo-generated VR parameters, for deep-penetration problems
this approach can be computationally prohibitive.

The Method of Automatic Generation of Importances by Calculation (MAGIC) is a
global variance reduction technique \cite{davis_comparison_2011} proposed by
Davis in 2011.
Rather than using a deterministic solution to obtain an estimate of the forward
flux to generate an importance map, the MAGIC method uses an analog Monte Carlo
run with multigroup cross section data and (optionally) a high energy cut-off.
This initial analog run is used to generate initial importance map for a
secondary run.
This process iterates until several Monte Carlo simulations are run and a
finalized importance map is generated.
In their paper, the authors compared three variants of MAGIC to FW-CADIS in ITER
fusion energy systems.
These three variants used different weight window adjustments for importances:
weight windows in cells based on existing weight information, weight windows in
mesh cells based on flux information, and weight windows in cells based on
population density.
Davis and colleagues concluded that the most effective method for variance
reduction in their system was MAGIC's weight window in mesh based on flux
information, where FW-CADIS' FOM was 65\% that of MAGIC's.
The authors did not make it clear how many iterations were required, on average,
to generate the finalized weight window map or if the time to iteratively
generate importance maps were included in the FOM.
It is unclear if only the final Monte Carlo simulation's runtime was used to
calculate the FOM.
Furthermore, the authors did not clearly state how the biasing parameters were
calculated, other than that they used flux, population density, or weight
information.

Peplow et al. \cite{peplow_comparison_2012} compared the performance of
Cooper's method, Van Wijk's method, Becker's method, and FW-CADIS
across a number of shielding calculations. For a simple shielding
problem, FW-CADIS had the shortest runtime, which included the forward and
adjoint deterministic times, and had a FOM 80x higher than the analog
calculation, and more than 3x the next best hybrid method. Van Wijk's method was
the only method other than FW-CADIS to pass all statistical convergence checks
for the problem, but its reported FOM was lower than Becker's method and than
FW-CADIS. In a second deep penetration shielding problem, FW-CADIS was the
only method
that passed all statistical convergence checks. FW-CADIS also had the highest
reported FOM for this problem. The timing for all of the methods were
comparable. Peplow et al. also ran two ``challenge'' problems. As with the first
two problems, FW-CADIS outperformed the other methods and passed all statistical
checks. Becker's method was
consistently comparable to FW-CADIS in reported FOMs, but only passed all of the
statistical checks in a single challenge problem. Becker's method also performed
relatively better than the other methods in deep-penetration challenge problems.

The ubiquity and continued development of global variance reduction methods
illustrates the need and desire for them in the nuclear engineering community.
Some of the
methods discussed in this section--including Becker's global weight windows,
Cooper's weight windows, Van Wijk's method, and FW-CADIS--have
been applied to a number of nuclear
application problems. All of them reduce the time to a ``good'' solution when
compared to analog Monte Carlo. When compared against one another, FW-CADIS
consistently outperforms the other methods.
