\section{Automated Variance Reduction Methods for Global Solutions}
\label{sec:GlobalVR}

The previous section detailed several methods that automate variance reduction
for localized tallies. However, for global solutions these methods do not work
well. The global tally suffers from a large range in variance across the
physical problem space, and the solution is dependent on the flux distribution
throughout the problem. Here several methods are described that provide
automated variance reduction for global solutions or multiple tallies.

Cooper and Larsen developed a weight window technique to reduce the variance of
Monte Carlo global solutions \cite{cooper_automated_2001}. In their work, Cooper
and Larsen utilized a forward solution to the transport equation to generate
paramaters for a modified Monte Carlo simulation where the particles are nearly
uniformly distributed throughout the problem. By doing so, the variance in the
scalar flux remained relatively constant throughout the problem, rather than
rising significantly with increasing distance from the forward source. Cooper's
"isotropic" weight windows dependent on $\vec{r}$ are given by:
\begin{subequations}
\label{coopers}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{ww}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\phi(\vec{r})}{max \phi(\vec{r})}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  ww(\vec{r})_{top} = \rho \bar{ww}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
b, the linearly anisotropic factor, is
\begin{equation}
  ww(\vec{r})_{bottom} = \frac{\bar{ww}(\vec{r})}{\rho}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the weight window scaling factor
\end{subequations}

In practice, Cooper's algorithm was to iteratively switch between solving the
diffusion equation with transport correctors (eddington factors); a process
known as quasidiffusion, and with a Monte Carlo solution. An initial
quasidiffusion solution was used to generate weight windows, and then after a
time the Monte Carlo solution was used to generate updated eddington factors for
the quasidiffusion solution.

Because Cooper's method depended on Monte Carlo to generate the eddington
factors for the quasidiffusion problem, this method was limited by the iterative
switch between the quasidiffusion solution and the Monte Carlo solution. The
frequency by which this switching happens is entirely up to the user, but may
drastically affect the efficiency of the method. Further, Cooper notes that we
do not know at what point in time (for which number of particles N) the Monte
Carlo solution becomes more accurate than the quasidiffusion solution, which is
an important issue in choosing solution parameters.

Becker, in addition to developing a local VR method, developed a global space-
energy- weight correction method both with (Section \ref{sec:AngleVR}) and
without directional biasing: \cite{becker_hybrid_2007, becker_hybrid_2009}.

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq.beckerglobal}
Becker's global method utilizes a formulation of the energy- and space-
dependent contributon flux like eqs. \eqref{beckerconributon} and
\eqref{eq:beckerconributonspace}, but defines the spatial parameter as:
$B(\vec{r})$:
\begin{equation}
  B(\vec{r}) = \tilde{\phi^c}(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
Similarly to FW-CADIS, Becker's method defines a different adjoint source
distribution depending on the response desired for the calculation:
\begin{equation}
  q^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{1}{\phi(\vec{r},E)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  q^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{\sigma_d(\vec{r},E)}
                                {\int_0^{\inf} \sigma_d(\vec{r},E) dE}
\end{equation}
The space- and energy- dependent weight windows are:
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w}(\vec{r},E) = \frac{B(\vec{r}}{\phi^{\dagger}(\vec{r},E)}
\label{eq:beckerglobalww}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Becker's method is similar to both Cooper's earlier method, but like FW-CADIS,
the global response weight window is proportional to the forward response, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w}(\vec{r},E) \propto \frac{\int sigma(\vec{r},E) phi (\vec{r},E) dE}
                                  {\sigma (\vec{r},E)}
\end{equation}
rather than the forward flux
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w}(\vec{r},E) \propto \phi(\vec{r},E)
\end{equation}
 as it is with Cooper's method.

 In implementation, both Becker's global method and Cooper's global method
 undersampled the source (in comparison to FW-CADIS) for a specified calculation
 time. However, Becker's method sampled 1/3 the number of particles that
 Cooper's method did. Becker's method, however, did obtain better relative
 uncertainties for low values in the problem [cite ORNL internal document].

Van Wijk's method, like CADIS and FW-CADIS, is a variance reduction method
designed to operate with little user input \cite{van_wijk_easy_2011}.
Van Wijk et al. applied their method to a PWR facility and observed a FOM
increase by a factor of $>$200.


The Method of Automatic Generation of Importances by Calculation (MAGIC) is a
global variance reduction technique \cite{davis_comparison_2011} proposed by
Davis in 2011.
Rather than using a deterministic solution to obtain an estimate of the forward
flux to generate an importance map, the MAGIC method uses an analog monte carlo
run with multigroup cross section data and (optionally) a high energy cut-off.
This initial analog run is used to generate initial importance map for a
secondary run.
This process iterates until several monte carlo simulations are run and a
finalized importance map is generated.
In their paper, the authors compared three variants of MAGIC to FW-CADIS in ITER
fusion energy systems.
These three variants used different weight window adjustments for importances:
weight windows in cells based on existing weight information, weight windows in
mesh cells based on flux information, and weight windows in cells based on
population density.
Davis and colleagues concluded that the most effective method for variance
reduction in their system was MAGIC's weight window in mesh based on flux
information, where FW-CADIS' FOM was 65\% that of MAGIC's.
The authors did not make it clear how many iterations were required, on average,
to generate the finalized weight window map or if the time to iteratively
generate importance maps were included in the FOM.
It is unclear if only the final monte carlo simulation's runtime was used to
calculate the FOM.
Furthermore, the authors did not clearly state how the biasing parameters were
calculated, other than that they used flux, population density, or weight
information.

In 2007, Peplow, Blakeman, and Wagner \cite{peplow_advanced_2007} proposed three
methods by which variance reduction could be decreased in global mesh tallies in
deep-penetration radiation transport problems. The first method, using a CADIS
calculation where the adjoint source is defined at the problem boundary, aimed
at moving particles outward. The second method used standard CADIS but instead
defined each cell as equally important. The last method, called Forward-Weighted
CADIS (FW-CADIS), distributed the adjoint source across mesh cells as an inverse
relation to the forward response of the cell. In their work, Peplow et al found
that the first method had large uncertainties in areas of the problem distant
from the boundary; the second method, performed slightly better than analog, but
not significantly, and the third method had the most uniform uncertainty
distribution.

FW-CADIS
\cite{wagner_forward-weighted_2007,wagner_forward-weighted_2009,wagner_forward-weighted_2010}
was the most successful in that it built off of existing theory, namely Cooper's
concept of using a forward deterministic calculation to evenly distribute
particles throughout the problem subspace, to obtain global tallies. However,
Wagner et al took a different approach than Cooper: by using a forward
deterministic estimate of the flux or desired response as the adjoint source for
an adjoint calculation, biasing parameters for global responses could be
calculated. The adjoint source for the adjoint calculation thus depends on the
desired response for the system. The generic description for the adjoint source
is given by Eq. \eqref{adjointsourcesimple} and more specific parameters are
given by Eqs. \eqref{FWCadglbaldose}-\eqref{FWCadglobalflux2}:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger}} (P)=\frac{\sigma_d(P)}{R}
\end{equation}
\label{eq:adjointsourcesimple}

The adjoint source for the spatially dependent global dose, $\int
\phi(\vec{r},E)\sigma_d(\vec{r},E) dE$:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r } ,E)= \frac { \sigma _{ d }(\vec { r } ,E) }
       { \int { \sigma _{ d }(\vec { r } ,E)\psi (\vec { r } ,E,) } dE }
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobaldose}

The adjoint source for the spatially dependent total flux $\int \phi(\vec{r},E) dE $:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r }) = \frac { 1 }{ \int { \phi (\vec { r } ,E) } dE }
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobalflux}

The adjoint source for the energy- and spatially- dependent flux $\phi(\vec{r},E)$:
\begin{equation}
  { q^{\dagger} }(\vec { r } ,E) = \frac { 1 }{\phi (\vec { r } ,E) }
\end{equation}
\label{eq:FWCadglobalflux2}
\end{subequations}
