\section{Monte Carlo Variance Reduction}

\subsection{Variance Reduction Techniques}
\label{sec:MCvar}

To begin a discussion on variance reduction techniques for monte carlo particle
transport,
it is necessary to first discuss variance reduction itself.

\textbf{describe the central limit theorem and how it relates to monte carlo
statistics here }

Estimate of the variance:
\begin{equation}
S^{ 2 }=\sum _{ i=1 }^{ N }{ \frac { (x_{ i }-\bar { x } )^{ 2 } }{ N-1 }  }
             \cong \bar{x^2}-\bar{x}^2
\label{eq:Var}
\end{equation}

The variance of the mean value, or variance of $\bar{x}$, follows as:
\begin{equation}
S^{ 2 }_{ \bar { x }  }=\frac{S^2}{N}
\label{eq:VarMean}
\end{equation}

From \ref{eq:VarMean}, one can see that relationship between variance and N follows:
\begin{equation}
S_{ \bar { x }  }=\sqrt { \frac { S^{ 2 } }{ N }  } =\frac { S }{ \sqrt { N }  }
\label{eq:VarN}
\end{equation}

The relative error normalizes the variance by the mean value.
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{S_{ \bar { x }  }}{\bar{x}}
\label{eq:RelativeErr}
\end{equation}

S to R relation
\begin{equation}
S^2\:\propto\: R^2\:\propto\:\frac{1}{N}
\label{eq:S to R}
\end{equation}

The figure of merit (FOM) is often used as a success metric for variance
reduction techniques.
This is because
\begin{equation}
FOM=\frac { 1 }{ R^{ 2 }T }
\label{eq:FOM}
\end{equation}

MCNP \cite{hendricks_mcnp_1985, brown_mcnp_2002} has a number of techniques for
variance
reduction included in its distribution. Overall, these variance reduction
techniques fall
into four general categories: truncation methods, population control methods, modified
sampling methods, and partially-deterministic methods. Of note for this discussion are
population control methods and modified sampling methods, which are discussed in
a number
of the papers referenced herein.

Population control methods either increase the particle population by splitting or
decrease the particle population by rouletting. Both splitting and roulette maintain a
fair game by adjusting the particle weights as splitting and rouletting are performed.
To use population control methods effectively as a variance reduction technique,
splitting
 is performed in high-importance regions and roulette is performed in
 low-importance
  regions. MCNP's population control methods include geometry, energy and time
  splitting
  and roulette, as well as a weight cutoff and weight windows. Weight windows
  utilize both
 splitting and roulette to keep particles within a desired weight range.

Modified sampling methods adjust transport by sampling from a different probability
distribution function than the actual distribution for the problem. This is
possible only
 if, as with population control methods, the particle weights are adjusted
 accordingly.
 The new probability distribution function should bias particles in regions of high
 importance to the problem tallies. In MCNP, a number of modified sampling
 methods exist.
 These include: the exponential transform, implicit capture, forced collisions, source
 biasing, and neutron-induced photon production biasing.

Truncation methods stop tracking particles in a region of phase-space that is of
low-importance to the tally. These methods can be used in space (a vacuum boundary
condition), energy (eliminate particles above or below a specified energy), or
time (stop
tracking after a given time). To effectively use these methods, the user must be
aware of
particles' importance to a tally result. If particles that are important to a
result are
 eliminated with a truncation method, the tally will be underestimated, and the
 solution
  will not incorporate the problem physics into the solution effectively.

The remainder of this literature review will focus on efforts to utilize population
control methods and modified sampling methods for variance reduction.

\subsection{Automated Variance Reduction Using Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:AutomatedVR}

It is important, in utilizing any variance reduction technique, to ensure that a
fair game
is being played. The user must ensure that the fundamental nature of the problem
is not
being changed by using a variance reduction technique, or the answer will not be
representative of the original problem. Automated variance reduction techniques aim to
eliminate this uncertainty for the user by estimating the importance of
particles in some
 way and then setting up variance reduction parameters automatically.

Early on, a number of methods explored automating some aspect of variance
reduction for
Monte Carlo. Some of these methods used a fast, low-particle Monte Carlo
transport run to gain an initial estimate for a cell's importance and generate
variance reduction parameters from them to bias a more computationally-intensive
run. Naturally, the variance reduction parameters generated by utilizing this
technique were limited by the statistical uncertainty in the figures used to
generate them. Furthermore, for deep-penetration particle transport, the
variance reduction parameters for low flux regions were exceedingly difficult to
generate.

As with any variance reduction technique, the goal to be achieved is a faster
time to achieve a solution for a desired uncertainty, and to reduce the variance
for the tally.
Thus the metrics for success are often the figure of merit (FOM) and the
variance for the tally obtaining the solution.
