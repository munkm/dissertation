\section{Sensitivity to Deterministic Angle Variations}
\label{sec:AngleResults}

Section \ref{sec:CharResults} showed that the $\Omega$-methods have a strong
weakness to ``thin'' materials, as CADIS and FW-CADIS do. This was confirmed by
running the steel beam problem with air and concrete in place of the beam; in
the ``thin'' material air version, CADIS-$\Omega$ performs less well than CADIS.
The characterization problem results also showed that
the incorporation of the $\Omega$-flux into a problem with materials with
strongly different moderating properties, the steel plate in concrete, showed
strong improvement when compared to both CADIS and nonbiased Monte Carlo.

Last, the parametric study will be performed on the most interesting results of
from the characterization problem results. Because the steel beam embedded in
concrete showed promising results, it is the problem that is covered in this
subsection. Recall that the CADIS-$\Omega$ had better results than CADIS for
for both a coarse and a finer mesh. CADIS-$\Omega$ had

\subsection{Parametric Study Description}
\label{subsec:parstudy}

The angle sensitivity parametric study will cover the subset of computational parameters
that are most likely to influence the $\Omega$ method's solution. Because the
$\Omega$-flux is calculated from an angle integration of the forward and adjoint
flux, calculation parameters that are most likely to influence the angular flux
solution are the variables that were perturbed.
The two parameters that will be studied
are the quadrature order and the P$_N$ order.

The quadrature used in a deterministic solution is used do discretize the
problem in angle. Quadrature options are split into two separate selections: the
quadrature set or type, and the quadrature order. Because the $\Omega$-methods
require rotational symmetry, only quadrature sets that have rotational
symmetry (generally these are triangular quadrature sets)
can be used with the $\Omega$-methods. In ADVANTG/Denovo, the triangular
quadrature sets are: linear-discontinuous finite element, level-symmetric, and
quadruple range. As discussed previously, quadruple range is selected as the
ADVANTG default because it has good properties and guarantees positivity in the
flux. Different quadrature sets have separate
properties and are a realm of study unto their own. Thus, we will vary only
quadrature order and not quadrature type in this sensitivity study.

Quadrature orders specify
how fine of a resolution the quadrature set will be. As quadrature order
increases, the size of the angular flux matrices will increase. We expect to
observe much slower deterministic recorded times for high quadrature orders
because of the I/O demand to read and write these values. Recall that the ADVANTG
default quadrature order is 10. The quadrature orders used for the sensitivity
study aimed to choose orders surrounding this value. This resulted in quadrature
orders 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 20 being chosen for variations in this
variable.

The P$_N$ order determines the fidelity of the scattering expansion. The
availability of P$_N$ orders is dependent on the cross section dataset. For the
27G19N cross section library, the P$_N$ order extends to 5. As a result,
P$_N$ orders of 1, 3, and 5 are chosen for variations in this parameter.

While the P$_N$ order
does affect angular information in the problem, it will not change the size of
the angular flux matrices. As a result, deterministic runtimes between
differing P$_N$ orders
may vary, but not as significantly as they will in differing quadrature orders
due to the lack of change in I/O demands as P$_N$ order changes.

Other deterministic parameters may influence the variance reduction parameters
calculated by the $\Omega$ methods.
The spatial discretization, while not a primary factor influencing
the angular flux, still may affect the $\Omega$-methods' performance.
A finer energy group structure may also influence the $\Omega$-method solution.
Finer energy groups will more effectively reflect resonance regions in
scattering and absorption. Scattering effects in certain energy regions will
have angular dependence and, thus, may be a stronger effect on the angular flux
than a coarser energy discretization. Because these particular solution effects
are not strongly tied to influencing the angular flux, they will not be included
in the angular sensitivity parametric study. This is because the effects on the
angular flux will be hard to isolate, and conclusions drawn
from them will be harder to make. However, a study extending to include the
energy group structure, the spatial discretization, and the quadrature type
certainly could be an area of future work.

Several factors in the deterministic calculation should not have a strong effect
on the angular flux distribution. These include the spatial solver, the
convergence criteria for the solvers, and the within group solver types.
Because these factors should not influence the angular flux any more than any
other part of the solution, they will not be included in this parametric study.
