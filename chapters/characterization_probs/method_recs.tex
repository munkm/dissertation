[Summarize results from characterization problems.] \\

[Summarize findings from angle sensitivity study.] \\

[Based on the results, we recommend that the following parameters be used for
the $\Omega$-methods.] \\

The characterization problems that were run were heavily biased towards
low-density streaming to induce anisotropy in the flux. In retrospect, this subset of
problems was not ideal for a method so dependent on weight-window type biasing,
because particle streaming allowed for particles to cross several orders of
magnitude in the flux before resampling. This meant that in a high-importance
region a particle may split many thousands of times in a new splitting event.
Unfortunately, the $\Omega$-methods are not immune to this issue and so suffered
the same effects as CADIS, even with positive effects like the reduction of ray
effects.

[Conclude chapter with potential application problems that the $\Omega$-methods
might apply to.] \\
