  $^1$ ADVANTG runs of the characterization problems
  were run on 16 cores of a 32 core node, with 256Gb of memory on
  an Oak Ridge National Laboratory compute cluster maintained by the Radiation
  Transport and Nuclear Systems Division. \\
  $^2$ MCNP runs of the characterization problems were run on the same
 machine, with 256Gb of memory but using all 32 cores of the node. \\
