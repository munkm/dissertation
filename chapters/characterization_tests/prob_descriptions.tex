\section{Description of the Characterization Problems}
\label{sec:AngleProbDesc}

\subsection{Descriptors of Anisotropy-Inducing Physics}

[From the problems that didn't work for other methods, extrapolate and describe
the physical reasons why these problems caused issues.]

[Make sure to talk about both physical effects and deterministically-introduced
issues, like ray effects.]

[Summarize physical effects, like streaming paths, highly heterogenous,
monodirectional sources, etc.]

\subsection{Problem Specifications}

[Describe problems that have streaming paths.]

[Describe problems that are highly heterogenous.]

[Describe problems with monodirectional sources.]

[Describe problems that have high scattering discontinuity.]
