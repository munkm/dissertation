\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusions}

Hybrid methods are and will be a realm of continued importance in radiation
transport methods development.
The application space and demand for hybrid methods continues to grow. With
this growth, accurately and efficiently modeling the physics of increasingly
complex problems is
paramount for safety and security. In this dissertation, a new set of hybrid
methods were
proposed, implemented, and characterized.
From this work, several pathways have
revealed themselves for future hybrid methods work.
