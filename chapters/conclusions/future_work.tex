\section{Suggested Future Work}
\label{sec:futurewrk}

\subsection{Software Improvement}
\label{subsec:softwareimp}

Subsection \ref{subsec:softwareimp} will address the improvements that could be
made to the software and analysis methods to enhance understanding of the omega
methods. First we will discuss how improving software performance will aid in
future work. Then we will discuss how extending the breadth of analysis will
help to understand the $\Omega$-methods further.

To calculate the $\Omega$ flux, an adjustment to either the adjoint flux is
required to ensure that the directional variable $\Omega$ is the same in both
fluxes, or that $\Omega_{adjoint} = \Omega_{forward}$. Because quadrature sets
are not always straightforward to interpolate, a rotationally symmetric
quadrature set is desirable for computing the $\Omega$ fluxes. Should a method
be developed that does have interpolatable quadrature points, it would be a good
candidate to calculate $\Omega$ fluxes for solutions that are not
rotationally symmetric.

\subsection{Characterization Problem Extension}
\label{subsec:extendcharprobs}

Subsection \ref{subsec:extendcharprobs} will describe how broadening the scope
of characterization problems is another fruitful avenue for exploration. In this
vein, there is a two-pronged approach: first extending the types of problems
(more diverse materials, less air in problems, more diverse geometries) will
enhance knowledge of the methods. Next, extending the scope of the parametric
will be discussed. In this vein, the deterministic calculation specifics, like
quadrature type will be addressed.

Because the mitigation of ray effects was observed in several of the problems
presented in Section \ref{sec:CharResults}, it would also be beneficial to
perform a more thorough investigation into the $\Omega$-methods' mitigation or
multiplication of ray effects. Both the forward and the adjoint angular fluxes
will have ray effects in problems with long mean free paths. As discussed in
that section, the ray effects may also be multiplied depending on the geometric
configuration of the problem. The degree to which the $\Omega$-flux exacerbates
or minimizes ray effects as a function of these locations would be an
interesting study and may help in further specifying to which problems the
$\Omega$-method is suited. Further, the difference in the construction of the
adjoint between CADIS and FW-CADIS means that CADIS-$\Omega$ and
FW-CADIS-$\Omega$ will have different sensitivities to ray effects. Comparing
these two would also be useful.

\subsection{Application Problems}
\label{subsec:appprobs}

Based on the data presented in Section \ref{subsec:}, we believe that the
$\Omega$ methods can be applied to a number of application problems. These
problems include, but are not limited to BLAH BLAH BLAH because of the following reasons.
