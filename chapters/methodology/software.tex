\section{Software}
\label{sec:software}

In this section the software in which the methods presented in section
\ref{sec:omegaintro} will be implemented. A brief summary of each piece of
software and what was implemented in each will be discussed.
While the details of the inner-workings of the software will not be described
here, both pieces of software have rich documentation and user guides which an
interested reader may pursue at their leisure.

\subsection{The Denovo Discrete Ordinates Software}

Denovo $S_N$ is a three-dimensional discrete ordinates transport solver
developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory \cite{evans_denovo:_2010}. Denovo is a module in the larger
Exnihilo code suite, which in addition to Denovo,
includes: Omnibus, a frontend pre- and post-processing module; Transcore,
components used for radiation transport codes, including cross sections and
quadrature sets; Nemesis, software infrastructure and general algorithms;
Geometria, the geometry packages; Shift, a monte carlo radiation transport
solver; and Insilico, the front end used to couple Denovo and Shift. The
$\Omega$-fluxes are generated by running two independent-a forward and an
adjoint-determinstic solves in Denovo. The full angular flux maps for the
forward and adjoint solves are then saved to an hdf5[CITE HDF5 here] file. The
$\Omega$-fluxes are then generated by passing the angular flux maps through the
postprocessing module in Omnibus, and then the integration described in Eq.
\ref{eq:omega_basic} is performed, and then the scalar $\Omega$-fluxes are saved
to a .silo file and passed on to ADVANTG for variance reduction parameter
generation. Appendix [APPENDIX NUMBER HERE] contains the code added to Omnibus
used to perform this calculation.

\subsection{ADVANTG}

ADVANTG \cite{mosher_new_2010} is a software package
originally designed to automatically
generate variance reduction
parameters for the Monte Carlo radiation transport solver
MCNP \cite{brown_mcnp_2002}
using the CADIS
and FW-CADIS methods. For this work, the ADVANTG functionality was extended to
process the omega fluxes provided by Denovo and then generate variance reduction
parameters with these fluxes through CADIS and FW-CADIS. In addition to the
modifications required to perform said calculation, ADVANTG was further modified
modified to generate anisotropy quantification metrics and a modified version of
the scalar contributon flux, both of which were summarized in
section \ref{sec:anisotropy_quant}. The code used to reroute the $\Omega$-fluxes
through CADIS and FW-CADIS as well as to generate the anisotropy metrics in
ANDVANTG is included in [APPENDIX NUMBER HERE].
