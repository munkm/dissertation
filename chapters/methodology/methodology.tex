\chapter{Methodology}

The objective of this work is to develop a method that, like CADIS and FW-CADIS,
automatically generates variance reduction parameters for fixed-source,
deep-penetration radiation transport problems. This method will extend existing
methods to generate importance maps--that in turn generate variance reduction
parameters--that are informed by angle. This chapter will first
discuss the mathematical foundation of this new method. A discussion on how
the method's success will be quantified will follow. Finally, a description of
the software being used and how the method is added to this software will
conclude this chapter.
