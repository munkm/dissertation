\chapter{Methodology}

The objective of this work is to develop a method that, like CADIS and FW-CADIS,
automatically generates variance reduction parameters for fixed-source,
deep-penetration radiation transport problems. In general, the variance reduction
parameters generated by CADIS and FW-CADIS are not sufficient for
problems that are strongly
anisotropic in angle. The method will extend existing
methods to generate importance maps--that in turn generate variance reduction
parameters--that are informed by angle to remedy this issue. The first section
in this chapter will describe
the mathematical foundation of this new method. A discussion on how
the method's performance will be quantified follows. Finally, a description of
the software being used and how the method is added to this software will
conclude this chapter.
