\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

This dissertation endeavors to address a number of research objectives. The
primary research goal is to develop a hybrid method capable of generating
variance reduction parameters for highly anisotropic,
deep-penetration radiation transport
applications. Several supporting objectives accompany this goal. First, a
method will be proposed that capitalizes on a solid theoretical framework
and lessons learned from existing hybrid methods.
Next, the method will be implemented in such a way that it can be compared to
existing hybrid methods in a transparent and reproducible manner. To do so,
several problems that have anisotropic behavior will be formulated with which to
compare the new and existing methods. A rigorous and consistent set of metrics
will be devised to quantify method performance for each of these problems. By
addressing each of these objectives, the new method will be
proposed, developed, implemented, and characterized such that it is
well-understood and usable.
