\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

This dissertation addresses a number of research objectives. The
primary research goal is to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item develop a hybrid method capable of generating variance reduction
    parameters for highly anisotropic, deep-penetration radiation transport problems.
\end{itemize}
Several supporting objectives accompany this goal. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Propose a hybrid method that capitalizes on a solid theoretical framework
    and lessons learned from existing hybrid methods.
  \item Implement the method in a software package such that it is transparent
    and reproducible.
  \item Devise a rigorous and consistent set of metrics with which to quantify
    method performance.
  \item Develop a suite of problems that have anisotropic behavior induced by
    the problem physics with which to characterize the method.
  \item Run the method and existing hybrid methods on the suite of problems.
    Using the results obtained from these runs, compare the method's
    performance to exiting hybrid methods.
  \item Investigate the sensitivity of the method to other angular-flux
    perturbing parameters, such as the angular discretization of the
    deterministic transport.
\end{enumerate}
By
addressing each of these objectives, the new method will be
proposed, developed, implemented, and characterized such that its behavior in
different problems is well-understood and the method is usable by interested
parties that do not have the expertise of a developer or the author.
