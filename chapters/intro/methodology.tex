\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

In this dissertation, a new hybrid method that incorporates angular information
into the variance reduction parameters it generates is proposed. The method,
named the $\Omega$-method or CADIS-$\Omega$-method, rests on a strong
theoretical basis.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:motivation}, there are many flavors of hybrid
method that exist for radiation transport. This hybrid
method has been implemented in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory code suite
Exnihilo and hybrid methods software ADVANTG.
