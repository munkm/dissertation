\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Given the research objectives identified in Section \ref{sec:objectives}, a new
hybrid method that incorporates angular information into the variance reduction
parameters it generates will be proposed. The incorporation of angular
information will address issues of strong anisotropy in applications,
and aid in variance reduction for those problems.
In this dissertation, a new hybrid method that incorporates angular information
into the variance reduction parameters it generates is proposed. The method,
named the $\Omega$-method or CADIS-$\Omega$-method, rests on a strong
theoretical basis.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:motivation}, there are many flavors of hybrid
method that exist for radiation transport. The hybrid $\Omega$-methods
have been implemented in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory code suite
Exnihilo and hybrid methods software ADVANTG.
