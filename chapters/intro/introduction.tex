\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This dissertation covers the development,
implementation, and characterization
of a novel hybrid method for neutral particle, deep-penetration, radiation transport in
highly anisotropic problems. The method generates a forward-weighted adjoint
scalar flux, which is then used to consistently generate variance reduction
parameters for Monte Carlo radiation transport. Because of the incorporation
of directionality into the adjoint scalar flux,
the method has been named FW/CADIS-$\Omega$. The name alludes to the lineage of
the method, which builds off of
the Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS), and
Forward-Weighted CADIS (FW-CADIS) methods.
The work supporting the development of these methods not only help
to further characterize hybrid method performance, but also provide a novel
analytical framework by which to characterize problem physical behavior. This
work advances the current state of hybrid methods and extends the availability
for different hybrid methods in existing software.
