\section{Outline of the Dissertation}
\label{sec:outline}

The next several chapters of this dissertation will cover the relevant
background, the pertinent theoretical basis, and the numerical results that
address the research objectives outlined in Section \ref{sec:objectives}.
Chapter \ref{ch:lit_review} will provide a
comprehensive background on the theoretical basis for this work. 
This chapter will also provide context for the existing gaps for
generating variance reduction parameters in
highly anisotropic, deep-penetration radiation transport problems. It will further
highlight the most effective hybrid methods that can be applied to
non-anisotropic, deep-penetration radiation transport problems. 

Building on
the knowledge presented in Chapter \ref{ch:lit_review},
Chapter \ref{ch:methodology} will provide an overview of the
theoretical basis of the method developed for this project. The theory
presented in this chapter is novel and contributes to the larger body of hybrid
methods research. This chapter will also cover the software used for this
project, and in which ways it was modified to incorporate the novel theory
presented herein. Next, Chapter \ref{ch:charprobs} will present several problems
with which the method is to be characterized. The results from these problems
will inform a parametric angle-informed study, which will also be presented
later in the chapter. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions} will draw from the
results presented in Chapter \ref{ch:charprobs} to discuss the performance of
the new method, to summarize what was learned from the method characterization,
and to suggest future paths forward for future hybrid methods research.
