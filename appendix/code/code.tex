\chapter{Software for this Project}
\label{ch:codes}

% Come up with a better name for this lame ass chapter

The majority of the software for this method is available in open source
repositories. This includes the characterization problem inputs, the scripts
used to postprocess the HDF5 and SILO files, and the datasets that were used to
generate these results. The next few subsections of this appendix contain the
URLs and descriptions of how to access these publicly-available resources.
However, some of the software--namely the code added to
ADVANTG and the Exnihilo code suite--are export controlled and is not freely
available. The code used for that will be included here, and what is easily
separable is committed separately in a different repository.

The version of Exnihilo used to run this work was:\\
\textbf{branchname}: angular\_hybrid\_method \\
\textbf{commit hash}: 81fd08b8cc62b00ee72a2305c5f4493691acb059 \\

The version of ADVANTG used to run this work was:\\
\textbf{branchname}: MMM \\
\textbf{commit hash}: 03321f9fb084e3b9219c07c454e0c6d265a565f1 \\
