% The text of the abstract goes here.  If you need to use a \section
% command you will need to use \section*, \subsection*, etc. so that
% you don't get any numbering.  You probably won't be using any of
% these commands in the abstract anyway.

An abstract is not where I describe my work in the abstract; rather,
I will describe it in a descriptive and condensed manner. Let's call it
my mini thesis.
